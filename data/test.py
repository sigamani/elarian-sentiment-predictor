Yes you can have it scroll once, and just stay on the clock, but I like having other cards as well. God its the worst and SO irritating. I got it super cheap, so i just face the screen toward the wall and treat it like a Dot instead of a Spot. What a dumb move on Amazons​ part.", "NEG"),
("This product is a complete waste of money. When you ask Alexa a question she either doesn't know the answer, gives you the wrong answer or finds information off of Wikipedia!", "NEG"),

("Great product EXCEPT there is no possible way for it to act as a clock the displays the time PERMANENTLY. When in 'Clock' mode, the screen rotates between the clock face and a 'Things to Try' screen. I intended on buying several units for my house, but I do not need a screen in the house that is permanently trying to upset me. Acting as clock should be a BASIC feature of the Echo Spot. How could you get this wrong, Amazon?? #FAIL", "NEG"),
("I wanted to use this as a bedside clock with the ability to play music and podcasts. Sadly, it continuously scrolls the &#34;Things to try&#34; and won't stay on the clock face. Amazon is about to get this one back.", "NEG"),

("item returned for repair ,receivded item back from repair 07/23/18 . parts missing no power cord included.please advise", "NEG"),
("For as awesome as the Echo and Echo Dots are, the Spot is a disappointment. There is very little control over what the screen shows, what the clock looks like, what order things show up in, etc. At this point if I hadn't thrown the box away immediately, I would have sent it back and just got another full size Echo.", "NEG"),
("Product forces user to review Alexa Things to Try. There is no way to disable it.", "NEG"),
("Can’t be used as a baby monitor which is why I had purchased it. I didn’t realize this until I read the reviews on the Alexa skill for syncing the Nest Cam. Considering all of the poor reviews and the fact that it should be simple to fix, surprised Amazon hasn’t upgraded the software to allow more than 39 minutes of viewing or alerts like you get on the Nest app.", "NEG"),
("I own 3 of these... amazon is ignoring its customers and using these devices as a marketing tool. You can customize the screen contents, but you cannot turn off there advertising, Things to Try... People will suggest that you can, but you can only do so if you turn off all content changes which is not an acceptable option.Moreover, they should increase the size slightly, and improve the audio speaker. That would give you a 5 star device.Right now i’m debating whether to return all 3 devices. My wife says we should.", "NEG"),
("Disconnects often", "NEG"),
("The echo works fine but then you get indundated with &#34;Things to try&#34;. I am not a 10 year old that needs stimulus to tell me to do things. I found there is no way to turn this off except for .... turning off the screen. If I cannot find a suitable fix for this it goes back.", "NEG"),
("Can't turn of &#34;things to try&#34; on the screen scroll. This is a big promotion device for Amazon. Packing it up and sending it back. They really want to get in our heads. Enough already.", "NEG"),

("The product is attractive and somewhat useful, BUT, Amazon chose to force users to view their “things to try” and Trending”. This greatly depreciates the value of the product. Do not buy unless you are willing to view a billboard from Amazon.", "NEG"),
("It's not as good as Siri, BUT it still has some positives, it's great at playing music, and setting alarms. I personally felt that I paid too much for this product, as it was nearly half off on prime day (literally the day after I purchased it). So I'm pretty disappointed. I might still return it and get my money back. .", "NEG"),
("Fairly useless.", "NEG"),
("For the size of the screen this thing should be $25", "NEG"),
("Invasive and scared the crap out of me for speaking when it was not spoken to! CREAPY AF", "NEG"),
("I love the product , but very disappointed once I realized I can no longer play youtube videos. I'm now past my 30 days return date. I am realizing I now have an expensive alarm clock. I am hoping youtube comes back. I was looking to buy an echo show for the kitchen during prime day. Glad I didn't.", "NEG"),

("Thought it would be more powerful and have a lot more functionality. Not much better than the Echo dot. Not worth the money.", "NEG"),
("Do not understand all the excitement over these alexa devices or the google ones either. It rarely gets what I say correct, does not control the Dish receiver. Yes I set it up correctly, using the alexa app on my phone. We got this for 129, which is a good deal, ti is definately not worth the 229 price though. Maybe in another month it will get better, or either I have one that is just deaf and dumb. Really can not recommend this item at the current time", "NEG"),
("Very disappointed. Alexa doesn’t hear me and doesn’t respond to my requests.", "NEG"),
("I have been through 4 Shows now. And ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN BROKEN. It has been anything from screens that lose lines of resolution to timers and reminders going off an hour late or reminders that trigger when trying to set other reminders. I don't have these issues on my Dot or my Echo. Just on the Show. It would be nice if Amazon could get there act together and actually fix this thing.", "NEG"),
("Alexa is pretty dumb ,,,", "NEG"),
("Fire HD does so much more. Over priced pair of speakers.", "NEG"),
("Very intrusive, so I turn it off", "NEG"),
("It's like having another kid in the house; I have to constantly repeat myself.I can tell Alexa to do something clear as day, and according to the history, she hears something comeletely different.The device is really cool, and I like the concept, which is why it gets two stars. However, it just doesn't work as intended.I find myself irritated more often than not when I use this device.", "NEG"),
("The way the music sounds is poor quality", "NEG"),
("All of my echo devices stopped communicating properly with Sonos devices upon connecting the echo show to my account. Asking any echo device to play music on Sonos baffled the system that had previously worked flawlessly. This went on for two weeks until I eventually solved the problem that neither Amazon nor Sonos could figure out.", "NEG"),

("Always wanted one,till I got one, it's not at all what it's cracked up to be, it's hard to navigate I actually like the dot better.", "NEG"),
("Returned from repair with No repair done. It has a problem which requires it to be on for a while for the defective part to show itself.I sent it for repair and got it back without being fixed. The site gives no option to complain from the page.I have a echo spot which works perfectly in the same position.", "NEG"),
("Works fine, I just realize I don’t need this because I don’t use it.", "NEG"),
("Need to be able to connect to more 3rd party viceo apps", "NEG"),
("The tech isn’t there. It doesn’t understand most common words and is basically a glorified radio", "NEG"),
("The sound on these is terrible. It’s like a tin can. I love my echo but this item is awful.", "NEG"),
("Alexa didn’t know answers to many questions we asked. For example we asked how many cups in a pound and she said a pound is a form of money", "NEG"),
("no habla espanol", "NEG"),
("no it is broke and I can't get help fixing or replacing it", "NEG"),
("I’m still unable to connect any devices although it says it has a built in hub. So bought a bridge to connect the devices thinking that everything would sync and my other devices are still not discovered via my echo plus and I was looking forward to this feature. Being able to play music, check the weather etc is fine.", "NEG"),
("Terrible. Stopped working after one day.", "NEG"),
("It does not speak in Spanish,,,I bought it for my grandmother to have someone to talk to when I’m not around,,,,,no Spanish!", "NEG"),
("I am so disappointed in this product. I tried to install two different units and neither one of them were successfully completed. Hours with Amazon technicians.. resetting each of them. The app didn't connect the Echo Plus to the internet connection. Tried using the application on a phone, a tablet and on a Chromebook... No luck. There are no clean directions on the application. Probably sending this back to Amazon..mark this as Not ready for prime time.", "NEG"),
("The alexa is awesome but when i rcieved the light buld i did not know that u need another adapter to have the light buld to work. I was not aware of that. Disappointed", "NEG"),
("wish it had a battery or was described better as a plug in only item.", "NEG"),
("The echo part works fine. The hue hub is a disaster. It worked for a few months and then nothing. I spent 2 hours on the phone with tech support one =y to have to send it in for repair. I am now trying to reconnect my lights. What a pain. I am having to reset each light bulb. It can take up to 5 times to get it to reset. I have spent hours on this. I will say customer service was friendly and tried to be helpful. Stick with the echo and smart plugs for lamps.", "NEG"),
("It was supposed to come with a free Hue lightbulb on Amazon Prime Day. No light bulb arrived. False advertising!", "NEG"),
("Haven't had it a week and already it cannot connect to my network. Tried reconnecting manually and the echo never appears in the list of devices to connect. It will be on it's way back to Amazon", "NEG"),
("The Echo does not link to Direct tv even though they said it would. I have spent multiple hours on this. Made phone calls and texts. Also is missing free bulb.", "NEG"),
("Doesn't use apple music. It is worthless to me without it. Sound quality on it is also poor.", "NEG"),
("I'm sure the Echo is as cool as everyone says....but I won't get to try this one. Even though I have a Large covered porch.....the package was left on my top step on a day forecast for 100% chance of rain.....and rain it did, soaking the package. I'm not even going to open it and see how bad the damage is. This order has been cursed from the beginning. Ordered as a Birthday Gift and Delivery was not made on scheduled day. Now I get it, and its rain-soaked.", "NEG"),
("I am not tec smart enough to make it work at all. Will send it back if I cant get help. My eco dot works just fine. this is too complacated.I just wanted a bigger speaker.", "NEG"),
("Product does not. Light bar never went orange. I googled it and reset instructions actually differ from package instructions. I tried both. Product is defective", "NEG"),
("received the wrong product...was so excited to install it ...all excitement gone. Thank you Amazon.", "NEG"),
("At a volume setting of half or less, the speaker sounds like there is something rattling, crackling or vibrating in it. I'd understand if the volume was set higher. All speakers get distorted when over-driven. But this doesn't sound like this is an over-driven case; sounds like more of a rattle/crackle. Possibly because the bass is too high. Learned that there is no ability to adjust any of the sound characteristics (other than volume). I will attempt to exchange it assuming it is just an isolated problem.", "NEG"),
("I bought this for myself and i didn’t realize it had to be plugged in just to work. It isn’t convenient to make them always have to connect to a wall. It should’ve been more clear when i bought it.", "NEG"),
("Unit came with the wrong plug, will have to send back to Amazon.", "NEG"),
("The sound quality is not that good, especially for the price that you pay for this. I would recommend to get the Echo Dot and buy a better speaker instead. Maybe Sonos and use the Echo dot.", "NEG"),
("Didn’t really work as smooth as they make it seem like.", "NEG"),
("As an echo its great, Good sound quality and functionality. As a smart home hub, it sucks. No automation, no geo-fencing, no music syncing for hue, no z-wave. All it does is turn things on with your voice. Ended up buying a smartthing hub and transferring everything over.", "NEG"),
("Got this a few months ago with the idea that it will help control my smart bulbs and be useful with answering questions and getting daily weather updates.It’s far from being useful.Half the time when you “wake” the device to ask a question or initiate a command, it doesn’t hear what you say and turns off. Basically ignoring you. Often she is unable to answer basic questions.It’s been so frustrating. Alexa has been more work rather than making my life easier.I would return it but I’m past the return period...... zzzz", "NEG"),

("I will never buy anything Amazon makes again!This fire stick is not even a year old and it does nothing but restart and freeze up constantly. No warranty from Amazon in this should have been my first clue that it was a horrible device. I will never buy anything built by Amazon again.", "NEG"),
("Was loving it but starting in June Hulu stopped working and crunchyroll doesn’t work either. Probably will switch to something else soon.", "NEG"),
("It still doesn’t work. I bet if I call and let them know that, they will charge me for the 3rd time. Ridiculous.", "NEG"),

("Had to return it as Hulu does not work on device. It kept coming up with errors, and Hulu app not being able to open at times. It was hit and miss, and at times, Hulu will stop working right in the middle of a show or movie. Plus fire stick is very slow in opening the apps.", "NEG"),
("The Firestick we were sent doesn’t work. At all. Voice remote won’t even turn on. We did all the troubleshooting steps. Didn’t work. Contacted Amazon. They sent us a new one - with no remote/no way to control it! We gave up and got a Roku (which works great!)", "NEG"),

("It's constantly buffering, to the point where you can't watch anything without interruption. I purchased on Prime Day plus I used rewards to pay for it, so in the end I paid next to nothing. If I had paid full price for it I might want my money back. We stopped trying to use it and went back to our old streaming device. I know our internet service is not the issue because we do not have this problem with any other devices that we stream from.", "NEG"),

("Garbage...Even trying to watch Amazon Prime Video this piece of garbage looses internet connection half way thru a show. The cheapest Roku works 100 time better. DO not waste your time or money on this piece of garbage.", "NEG"),
("I would not recommend this to anyone. It won't load netflix or if it does on rare occasion it won't run the program all the way thru. It tells you the we are unable to process this title at this time. Try again later. It is not the Netflix site cause I can stream it just fine on my computer. Its the Firestick. very disappointing.", "NEG"),

("Seems to work ok, but no youtube tv? Really? can't believe they would ban an app that so many people want to use. I really wanted to like it, but when I couldn't install that particular app it became almost useless, almost. Does most other stuff just fine, but I'll stick with my Roku.", "NEG"),
("I am quite disappointed by this product.There clearly is a bug: half of the time I ask for a newsflash, two second after it starts, the whole thing stops and reboots for a couple of minutes. Same goes when I ask to play the radio. Also, many times it get confused when I ask to switch of &#34;the lights&#34;...as other items are also named the same, which is not true.

("This worked well for about 6 months but then stopped connecting to the internet (wifi) and none of the trouble shooting efforts worked. Amazon customer service couldn't help further and told me warranty was only 3 months, which was very disappointing, so they weren't willing to replace.", "NEG"),
